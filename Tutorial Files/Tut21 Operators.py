# # OPERATORS IN PYTHON:
# # Arithmetic Operators
# # Assignment Operators
# # Comparison Operators
# # Logical Operators
# # Identity Operators
# # Membership Operators
# # Bitwise Operators
#
# #Arithmetic Operators
# print("9 + 5 =", 9+5)
# print("9 - 5 =", 9-5)
# print("9 * 5 =", 9*5)
# print("9 / 5 =", 9/5)
# print("9 // 5 =", 9//5)   #floor division operator
# print("2 ** 5", 2**5)     #power
# print("10 % 5", 10 % 5)   #modulus operator gives remainder
#
# #Assignment Operators
# print("\nAssignment Operators")
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x += 2  #x=x+2
# print(x)
# x -= 2
# print(x)
# x /= 2
# print(x)
# x *= 2
# print(x)
# x **= 2
# print(x)
# x %= 2
# print(x)

#Comparoison Operators
# i = 5
# print(i == 5)
# print(i != 5) #not equals to
# print(i > 5)
# print(i < 5)
# print(i >= 5)
# print(i <= 5)

#Logical Operators
a = True
b = False
#print(a and b)

#Identity Operators
# print(a is a)
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)

#Membership Operators
list = [3, 3, 2, 33, 35,32, 39]
# print(324 not in list)
# print(32 in list)

#Bitwise Operators
# 0 = 00
# 1 = 01
# 2 = 10
# 3 = 11

print(0 | 3) #or
#00
#11
#ans= 11 #vertically solve kiya, 0 and 1 ka or 1, same other, so ans is 11, which is 3
print(1 & 2) #and
# 01
# 10
#ans= 00 #vertically solve kiya, 0 and 1 ka and 0, 1 and 0 ka and, so ans is 00, which is 0
